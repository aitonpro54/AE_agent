# Target App Execution Plan

## Active Baseline

This clean repository tracks AE Agent 2.0.0: a local After Effects CEP panel
backed by a local bridge daemon. The bridge remains the owner of provider
access, chat calls, AE plan validation, execution gates, logs, checkpoints, and
edit-session protection.

The clean migration intentionally starts without historical audit packet trees,
old execution-plan archives, runtime logs, or generated proof directories. The
old `AE_agent` repository remains the historical source.

## Current State

- Product/runtime files were copied without changing AE tool contracts, bridge
  API, CEP UI semantics, provider contracts, or recipe semantics.
- Current Full Intaker/importer tooling remains available for AE-specific tool
  intake and validation.
- Full Intaker/importer real-run commands now require explicit current ledger
  paths instead of defaulting to generated runtime ledgers from the old
  workspace.
- Generic SDK write/governance history was not copied. Future generic SDK work
  should happen in the sibling `codex-sdk-orchestrator-tool` or a separate
  reviewed migration.

## Progress

- 2026-06-04: Clean baseline created, validated, and prepared to become the
  active `AE_agent` repo.
- 2026-06-04: Cleanup review removed stale project-memory history, updated the
  MCP config example to the clean path, and added checks against old absolute
  project paths and the old importer ledger default.

## Guardrails

- Keep this plan compact and current.
- Do not recreate historical archive trees in this repository.
- Keep runtime outputs ignored and outside git.
- Treat Local/Ollama as explicitly requested only.
- Do not run broad/default CEP smoke, live mutation, dependency changes,
  push/PR, raw JSX copy, or external-provider planner validation without a
  separate milestone approval.

## Next Milestone

After directory replacement, verify the active Codex MCP config and any local
shortcuts point at `C:\Users\Ant\Documents\Codex\AE_agent`, then run read-only
CEP connectivity checks.

## Decision Log

- 2026-06-04: Created clean-project baseline in a new repository rather than
  rewriting the old repo history.
- 2026-06-04: Kept AE Agent product and current AE-specific Full
  Intaker/importer tools; excluded old audit packet history and plan archives.
- 2026-06-04: Removed default dependencies on the old generated importer ledger;
  future Full Intaker real runs must pass `--ledger <path>` explicitly.
- 2026-06-04: Preserved `docs/cleanup-migration.md` as the only intentional
  old-repo pointer.

## Validation

- Required for the migration milestone: static no-old-reference checks,
  touched-file syntax checks, `git diff --check`, `npm run check:rules`,
  product smoke scripts, and retained Full Intaker/importer smoke scripts.
- Cleanup-review validation passed: touched-file `node --check`,
  `npm.cmd run check:rules`, static stale-reference search, `git diff --check`,
  `npm.cmd run smoke:bridge`, and `npm.cmd run smoke:full-intake`.

## Handoff

Use `.codex/handoff.md` for compact continuation state after each milestone.
